### **Question 2: Database Design and Querying**

---

**(a) Which aggregate function is used here?** [1]

**Answer:**

The aggregate function used is `AVG()`.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Understanding the Function:** The `AVG()` function calculates the average of values in a specified column. In this case, it is used to determine the average score of students in the test results.
- **Real-World Scenario Connection:** Average calculations are commonly used in student performance monitoring systems, financial data analysis, and other scenarios where mean values are important.

**Common Pitfalls and Mistakes:**

- Confusing `AVG()` with `SUM()`, which adds values instead of averaging them.
- Forgetting to group data when using `AVG()` in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause.

**Important Points to Remember:**

- The `AVG()` function is one of the basic SQL aggregate functions that should be mastered.
- Grouping is essential when calculating averages for subsets of data (e.g., per year, per category).

**Key Takeaways:**

- Aggregate functions like `AVG()` are fundamental tools for summarizing data in SQL queries.

---

**(b) There is a problem with the database design that risks making the aggregation incorrect. What is it, and how could it be resolved?** [6]

**Answer:**

The problem arises due to potential data redundancy or incorrect grouping in the aggregation query. If attributes like age or gender are calculated rather than stored as static values, inconsistencies may result in skewed averages.

**Solution:** Normalize the database and ensure that age is consistently calculated from `BirthDate` rather than stored directly. Grouping should be based on consistent and static attributes.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Normalization Issues:** Storing age directly rather than calculating it from `BirthDate` can lead to incorrect aggregations, especially as students get older.
- **Improving Aggregation Accuracy:** By calculating age dynamically using `TIMESTAMPDIFF`, the risk of outdated or inconsistent age data is minimized.
  
**Real-World Scenario Connection:**

In real-world educational systems, aggregations based on dynamic attributes like age or calculated scores need to be accurate. Proper normalization and grouping practices ensure the reliability of such aggregated data.

**Common Pitfalls and Mistakes:**

- Storing dynamic data like age in the database rather than calculating it when needed.
- Inconsistent grouping criteria leading to skewed or incorrect results.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Understanding how to grant precise permissions in SQL is essential for managing secure and efficient databases.

---

**(d) From the point of view of handling confidential information about minors, it would be better to give access only to aggregated data. How would you achieve that?** [4]

**Answer:**

Create a view that provides only aggregated data, such as average scores, without exposing individual records:

```sql
CREATE VIEW AggregatedData AS
SELECT Gender, City, AVG(Score) AS AverageScore
FROM Test
GROUP BY Gender, City;
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Using Views for Aggregation:** The view restricts access to individual records by presenting only aggregated summaries, reducing the risk of exposing confidential information.
- **Limiting Data Exposure:** Aggregated views are a common way to comply with data privacy laws while still providing valuable insights.

- Forgetting to consider edge cases like small sample sizes that might still reveal identifiable information.

**Important Points to Remember:**

- Use views to aggregate data when dealing with sensitive information.
- Always assess whether aggregation methods sufficiently protect individual identities.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Aggregating data is a fundamental method for balancing privacy and the need for insights in sensitive applications.

---

**(e) What limitation would that create for the researcher?** [1]

**Answer:**

The limitation is that the researcher cannot access individual records or perform more granular analysis, potentially missing out on important insights that require detailed data.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Impact on Research Flexibility:** By only having access to aggregated data, the researcher loses the ability to explore patterns, outliers, or correlations that may be present at the individual level.
  
**Real-World Scenario Connection:**

In educational research, aggregated data can hide significant details, such as the performance of subgroups or individuals who deviate from the norm, which may be critical for targeted interventions.

**Common Pitfalls and Mistakes:**

- Relying too heavily on aggregated data when more detailed analysis is needed.
- Overlooking important trends hidden within individual-level data.

**Important Points to Remember:**

- Aggregation improves privacy but can limit the depth of analysis.
- Researchers often need a balance between privacy and data access to draw meaningful conclusions.

**Key Takeaways:**

- While aggregated data protects privacy, it can limit the effectiveness and granularity of research analysis.

**(f) Database users have found several issues that come from the structure of the data model. These focus on the Student table. This table is defined by the following MySQL command:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
  ID VARCHAR(25) PRIMARY KEY,
  GivenName VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
  FamilyName VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
  Gender ENUM('M', 'F') NOT NULL,
  BirthDate DATE NOT NULL,
  School VARCHAR(130),
  City VARCHAR(130)
);
```

**What problems can you see with this table, and how would you resolve them? Be as specific as you can be.** [8]

**Answer:**

**Problems:**

1. **ID as VARCHAR:** Using a `VARCHAR(25)` for the primary key may lead to inconsistencies and inefficiency in indexing.
2. **Limited Gender Enum:** The gender field only allows binary values ('M', 'F'), which may be considered restrictive in certain contexts.
3. **Lack of Referential Integrity:** The `School` and `City` fields are free-text fields that could lead to inconsistent data entries.
4. **Potential Redundancy:** The table design could lead to data redundancy and update anomalies due to repeated entries for `School` and `City`.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use an Integer ID:** Replace `ID VARCHAR(25)` with `INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY` to improve indexing and consistency.
2. **Broaden Gender Options:** Expand the gender options or allow for a more flexible approach using another table or accepting nulls.
3. **Normalize the Table:** Create separate tables for `School` and `City` with proper foreign keys to enforce data integrity.
4. **Improve Data Integrity:** Introduce referential integrity by linking the `School` and `City` fields to normalized tables.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Normalization:** The existing table structure violates normalization principles, leading to data redundancy and potential integrity issues. Splitting `School` and `City` into separate tables would follow normalization best practices.
- **Primary Key Considerations:** Using a numerical ID improves efficiency, especially when handling large datasets or joins.

**Real-World Scenario Connection:**

Normalization is essential in any system dealing with repeated entities (e.g., schools or cities). For instance, a university database with multiple students from the same city benefits from a normalized structure to avoid redundant data.

**Common Pitfalls and Mistakes:**

- Using free-text fields for entities that should be normalized.
- Overlooking the impact of primary key data types on performance.

**Important Points to Remember:**

- Normalization prevents redundancy and ensures consistent data.
- Proper primary key selection improves indexing and performance.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Database design must balance normalization, data integrity, and performance for robust and scalable systems.

**(c) What would be selected by evaluating the XPath expression `//fileDesc//title/@type`?** [2]

**Answer:**

The XPath expression would select the value of the `type` attribute for the `title` element inside `fileDesc`. 

**Result Returned:**

In the provided XML fragment:

```xml
<fileDesc>
  <title type="collection">Christ Church MSS.</title>
</fileDesc>
```

The XPath expression `//fileDesc//title/@type` would return:

```plaintext
collection
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **XPath Syntax:** The double slashes (`//`) indicate that the search can occur at any level within the document, allowing for flexible navigation through nested structures.
- **Attribute Selection:** The `@type` syntax specifies that the expression is selecting the value of the `type` attribute, not the element itself.

**Real-World Scenario Connection:**

---

**(d) What would be selected by evaluating `//resp[text()= 'Cataloguer']/../persName`?** [2]

**Answer:**

The expression would select the `persName` elements that are siblings of the `resp` element containing the text `'Cataloguer'`.

**Result Returned:**

In the provided XML fragment:

```xml
<respStmt>
  <resp>Cataloguer</resp>
  <persName>Ralph Hanna</persName>
  <persName>David Rundle</persName>
</respStmt>
```

The XPath expression `//resp[text()= 'Cataloguer']/../persName` would return:

```plaintext
Ralph Hanna
David Rundle
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Sibling Navigation:** The `../` syntax moves up from the `resp` element to its parent, allowing the selection of sibling elements.

---

**(f) This element refers to the second textual item (such as a story or sermon) that the manuscript contains – hence `n=2`. How well would this way of listing contents work in a relational model? How would you approach the problem?** [8]

**Answer:**

Listing contents using positional indicators like `n=2` is not ideal for relational models. A better approach would be to introduce a separate table linking items with a sequential index.

**Solution:** Create a junction table with fields like `ManuscriptID`, `ItemNumber`, and `ItemContent`. This approach separates the content from its sequence, allowing for flexible indexing and easy reordering.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Positional Data in Relational Models:** Positional references (like `n=2`) are not well-suited to relational models since they rely on implicit ordering, which relational databases do not inherently maintain.
- **Normalizing the Data:** By separating content from its sequence in a junction table, reordering, querying, and maintaining the data become simpler and more efficient.

**Real-World Scenario Connection:**

In content management systems, managing sequential content (e.g., chapters in a book) is common. Using normalized tables allows flexibility in managing the sequence without hardcoding positions.

**Common Pitfalls and Mistakes:**

- Hardcoding positions directly in the data model, leading to rigid and error-prone systems.
- Ignoring the need for flexibility in ordering content.

**Important Points to Remember:**

- Use separate tables and explicit indexing for managing ordered data in relational databases.
- Avoid relying on implicit order, which can lead to maintenance challenges.

**Key Takeaways:**



- Relational models handle sequence best when using explicit indexes or junction tables rather than positional indicators.

Relational databases are often used as backend stores for linked data, where the need for structured queries and referential integrity is paramount.

**Common Pitfalls and Mistakes:**

- Mismanaging foreign keys, leading to orphaned records.
- Failing to normalize data, resulting in redundant storage.

**Important Points to Remember:**

- Relational tables should be designed with clear primary and foreign key relationships.
- Ensuring referential integrity is key to maintaining consistent data.

**Key Takeaways:**

- A well-designed relational schema is critical for maintaining data integrity and supporting complex queries in linked data systems.

**(g) Give a MySQL query equivalent for the scholar’s query you corrected in question 3(d).** [3]

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT body, creator
FROM Annotations
JOIN Persons ON Annotations.creatorID = Persons.creatorID
JOIN Sources ON Annotations.sourceID = Sources.sourceID
WHERE Sources.sourceName = 'Chapter3';
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **SQL Joins:** The query uses joins to connect the annotations with their creators and sources, filtering by the chapter name.
- **Relational Equivalence:** The structure mirrors the SPARQL query by matching relationships in a relational model.

**Real-World Scenario Connection:**

Translating between SPARQL and SQL is common when dealing with hybrid systems that integrate RDF data with relational backends.

**Common Pitfalls and Mistakes:**

- Mismanaging joins, leading to incorrect or incomplete results.
- Failing to apply the correct filters when translating from one query language to another.

**Important Points to Remember:**

- SQL provides powerful querying capabilities, but understanding how to translate from other languages like SPARQL is key in mixed environments.
- Always ensure that joins and filters are correctly applied.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Mastering SQL joins and filters is essential for querying complex relational data that models linked data structures.
